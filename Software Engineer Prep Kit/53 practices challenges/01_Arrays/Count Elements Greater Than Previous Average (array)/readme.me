# Count Elements Greater Than Previous Average

## 📝 Problem Description
Given an array of positive integers, the task is to return the number of elements that are **strictly greater** than the average of all previous elements. The first element is always skipped since there are no previous elements to compare it against.

## 💡 Example
**Input:** `responseTimes = [100, 200, 150, 300]`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:**
* **Day 0:** `100` (no previous days, skip)
* **Day 1:** `200` > average(100) = 100 → count = 1
* **Day 2:** `150` vs average(100, 200) = 150 → not greater → count = 1
* **Day 3:** `300` > average(100, 200, 150) = 150 → count = 2
* **Final Result:** `2`

## ⚙️ Specifications

### Input Format
1. The first line contains an integer `n` (**0 ≤ n ≤ 1000**), representing the number of days.
2. If `n > 0`, the next `n` lines contain an integer representing `responseTimes[i]`.
3. If `n = 0`, the second line is omitted or empty.

### Constraints
* `0 <= responseTimes.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= responseTimes[i] <= 10^9` for `0 <= i < responseTimes.length`

### Output Format
* A single integer depicting the count of days that meet the criteria.

## 🧠 Approach & Optimization
To solve this problem efficiently, we avoid recalculating the sum of the array from scratch at every step, which would result in a quadratic time complexity. 

Instead, we keep a **running sum** of the elements we have seen so far. We use the variable **`x`** to store the count of elements that satisfy the condition. At each iteration `i` (starting from 1):
1. We calculate the previous average by dividing the running sum by `i`.
2. If the current element
